# <span className="mt-4 block">easy — quick ux wins</span>

Below is the **easy-level checklist** based on Vercel’s UX guidance. Each item takes **2–5 minutes** to implement and provides a quick, noticeable improvement. The reference for all guidelines is [Vercel’s design principles](https://vercel.com/design/guidelines).

## interactions

### Scale your buttons

<ScaleButtonDemo />

One easy way to make your interface feel instantly more responsive is to add a subtle scale down effect when a button is pressed. A scale of 0.97 on the :active pseudo-class should do the job

\
**Why it matters:** It provides immediate tactile feedback, making interactions feel
faster and more satisfying.

---

### loading buttons keep their label

<LoadingButtonDemo />

Show a spinner while maintaining the original button label.

\
**Why it matters:** Prevents layout shift and lets users know which action is in
progress without losing context.

---

### no dead zones

<NoDeadZoneDemo />

Make the entire visible area of a control interactive.

\
**Why it matters:** Users shouldn’t guess where to tap; a larger clickable area prevents
frustration and improves usability.

---

### clear focus states

Make keyboard navigation obvious by using `:focus-visible` for single controls and `:focus-within` for grouped controls.

\
**Why it matters:** Users navigating via keyboard or assistive devices can clearly
see where focus is, improving accessibility and reducing confusion.

---

### larger, forgiving hit targets

Ensure every clickable element has a hit area of **at least 24px**, even if the visual icon is smaller.

\
**Why it matters:** Small targets frustrate users, especially on mobile. Expanding
the touch area improves interaction reliability.

---

### mobile-friendly input sizing

Set mobile `<input>` font-size to **16px or larger**.

\
**Why it matters:** Prevents iOS Safari auto-zoom when inputs are focused, ensuring
layout stability and a smoother typing experience.

---

### respect browser zoom

Never disable pinch-zoom or viewport scaling.

\
**Why it matters:** Users with low vision or specific accessibility needs rely on
zooming. Disabling it can harm accessibility.

---

### allow paste everywhere

Never block pasting into `<input>` or `<textarea>` fields.

\
**Why it matters:** Blocking paste interrupts users, slows workflows, and can break
accessibility.

---

### use ellipsis correctly

For follow-up or loading actions, use an ellipsis: `Rename…`, `Saving…`.

\
**Why it matters:** Communicates that an action is ongoing or continues, creating
a familiar UX pattern.

---

### prevent double-tap zoom

Add `touch-action: manipulation;` to interactive elements on mobile.

\
**Why it matters:** Stops accidental zooming during taps, making controls feel more
responsive.

---

### customized tap highlight

Set `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` to match your theme.

\
**Why it matters:** Ensures the touch highlight aligns with your design, avoiding
jarring visual feedback on mobile.

---

### use real links for navigation

Always use `<a>` or `<Link>` for navigation instead of buttons or divs.

\
**Why it matters:** Maintains standard browser behaviors like middle-click, Cmd/Ctrl+Click,
and open-in-new-tab functionality.

---

### controlled overscroll

Use `overscroll-behavior: contain;` in modals or drawers.

\
**Why it matters:** Stops the background page from scrolling when users interact
with overlay content, keeping interactions predictable.

---

### autofocus where it makes sense

Enable autofocus on desktop when there’s a single primary input. Avoid on mobile.

\
**Why it matters:** Improves efficiency for desktop users without causing layout
shift or unexpected keyboard opening on mobile.

---

## animations

### respect prefers-reduced-motion

Provide reduced-motion variants for users who prefer minimal animation.

\
**Why it matters:** Supports accessibility preferences and reduces motion sickness
or distraction.

---

### prefer css-based animations

Use CSS transitions instead of JavaScript for simple motion.

\
**Why it matters:** CSS animations are smoother and less likely to block the main
thread.

---

### avoid `transition: all`

List only the properties you want to animate, such as `opacity` or `transform`.

\
**Why it matters:** Avoids unintended layout recalculations that can cause jank.

---

### compositor-friendly motion

Animate only GPU-accelerated properties like `transform` and `opacity`.

\
**Why it matters:** Ensures smoother animations and reduces performance issues.

---

### svg transform reliability

Wrap SVG elements in `<g>` and use `transform-box: fill-box;`.

\
**Why it matters:** Prevents inconsistent scaling and transform-origin issues across
browsers, especially Safari.

---

## layout

### optical alignment

Adjust ±1px when visual alignment feels better than strict geometric alignment.

\
**Why it matters:** Small tweaks improve perceived precision and aesthetic harmony.

---

### respect safe areas

Use CSS environment variables (`env(safe-area-inset-*)`) for devices with notches.

\
**Why it matters:** Prevents content from being hidden or clipped on modern devices.

---

### remove accidental scrollbars

Fix unintentional overflow issues.

\
**Why it matters:** Avoids visual clutter and unexpected scroll behavior, keeping
the interface clean.

---

### let css do the sizing

Use `display: flex` or `grid` rather than measuring with JavaScript.

\
**Why it matters:** Reduces layout thrashing and ensures responsive layouts without
heavy scripting.

---

## content

### curly quotes

Use “smart” quotes instead of straight quotes.

\
**Why it matters:** Improves typographic polish and readability.

---

### avoid widows/orphans

Use CSS or manual edits to prevent single words on new lines.

\
**Why it matters:** Keeps text visually pleasing and readable.

---

Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;` for aligned numeric data.

\
**Why it matters:** Helps users compare numbers easily in tables or financial data.

---

\
**Why it matters:** Improves accessibility for screen readers.

**Why it matters:** Native elements provide better browser behavior and accessibility.

---

### add a skip link

Include a “Skip to content” link at the top of pages.

\
**Why it matters:** Allows keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation links.

---

### non-breaking spaces

\
**Why it matters:** Keeps important elements together for readability.

---

## forms

### enter submits single-field forms

Pressing Enter should submit forms with a single input.

\
**Why it matters:** Improves efficiency and follows user expectations.
