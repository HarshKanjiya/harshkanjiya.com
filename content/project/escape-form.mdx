## TLDR;

Escape Form is a full-stack form-building platform focused on flexible, embeddable, and workflow-driven data collection.  
The system is split into three independent applications:

- **Dashboard App** — project management, form builder, analytics shell  
- **Marketing Site** — product pages and onboarding funnel  
- **Form Submission Client** — (pending) public form rendering and submission handling


## Tech Stack

- Currently built entirely with **Next.js** with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS v4.
- A migration to **Golang** for backend services is planned in the future if scale demands it.


## Current Progress

### Completed
- **Dashboard & Marketing sites**
- **Basic form-creation flow**
- **Project and form management structure**

### In Progress
- **Node-based flow editor** for conditional logic and multi-step workflows  
- **Analytics module** for submission trends and performance data  
- **Form Submission site** implementation

---

## Future Roadmap
- **Submission queues** for reliable, high-volume form processing  
- **Embeddable forms** with a lightweight client runtime  
- **React NPM package** to render forms via a unique form key  
- **Advanced workflow automation** and integration capabilities
